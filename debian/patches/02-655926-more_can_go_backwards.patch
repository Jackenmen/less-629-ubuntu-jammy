 .B Less
 is a program similar to
 .BR more (1),
-but which allows backward movement
-in the file as well as forward movement.
-Also,
-.B less
+but it has many more features.
+.B Less
 does not have to read the entire input file before starting,
 so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
 .BR vi (1).
